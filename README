Graph-Layderer version 0.01
===========================

This multi-module distribution consists of two tightly-bound modules,
Graph::Layouter and Graph::Renderer.

Graph::Layouter is a generic module for taking a given graph (Graph instance)
and layouting it onto some virtual pane. That is, it assigns each node
particular coordinates based on its position in the graph.
Graph::Layouter::Spring is bundled with this distribution, containing the
popular spring algorithm implementation, but you can easily implement own
algorithm and fit it to the framework.

Graph::Renderer is another generic module, which takes a given graph containing
layouting information (as generated by Graph::Layouter, but noone says you must
use Graph::Layouter) and lays the nodes and edges down to an image, using some
image drawing tool. Graph::Renderer::Imager is bundled with this distribution,
but again you could easily write own one.


This is the initial version. The interface is very rough and unpolished, and it
is all still a work in progress. It already contains all the basic
functionality, though.

INSTALLATION

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:
